v0.1.2:
=======

* Last release got mangled with PaxHeaders in directories which seems to be due
  to an issue with bsdtar in later versions of OS X.

v0.1.1:
=======

* Update to ruby-install version 0.3.4
* Bump dependencies
* Ark extracts ruby-install tarball to /tmp otherwise it defaults to being
  extracted to /usr/local/ruby-install1.  Once the ruby-install bin is installed
  with `make install` the extracted tarball is no needed.

v0.1.0:
=======

* Initial release.
